# IcyClimb

This mini-game is my first practice VR project.

## Development log

### Initial setup
* Unity 3D URP project with the following packages:
** OpenXR and XR Interaction toolkit with samples and simulator
** Native oculus spatializer
** Did NOT install the Mixed Reality features. I want to see if I need them at all.
* Two builds: High quality for PC and Balanced for Android (targeting Oculus Quest 2)
* Fixed timestep set for 72Hz (0.0138)
